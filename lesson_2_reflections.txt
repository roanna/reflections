What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository a new hidden folder is being created. You can
    create the repository even from existing files and folders.
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
    
    Staging area shows you recent changes in your files that wil be commited,
    working directory is the place where your files are and repository consists 
    of all stages and commits of your files that were made.
