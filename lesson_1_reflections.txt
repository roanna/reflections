How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Using diff helps me to see the deffernce between two files more easily and quickly.
    I really do not need to compare filed line by line manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    Having easy access to the entire history could save my time while developing
    a huge product.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    When ypu choose manually to commit you could lost your data during unwxpected
    situation. But on the other hand it helps you to commit more logical parts of
    your code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Google Docs is not the version controll system, it is a online storage
    file system with the ability to see the versions of your file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    You can easily use git diff and git log to view defferences between your
    files. Also you can explore exactly what lines had been affected.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    You could return at you previously working code at any time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to try git for my course projects and for coursera assignments.
